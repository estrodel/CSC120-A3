- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
n/a

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I had taken AP CS in highschool like 8-9 years ago and am shocked how much I forget. Had trouble getting scanner to work and work with arrays since their are commands from R that I'm used to and don't have.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
It's tough because I haven't done that much python but you just have to know alot more about what is actually happening. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Woof maybe start simpler? I have a hard time not trying to get things perfect and there was a pretty high ceiling on this one which was tough. Especially with handling semantic meanings. Tried to use an NLP at one point rip. But i probably should have just tried to get it working at smaller stages.
